    <h3>Class of 2020</h3>
    <div class = "quote"><p>Powell is a 5-foot-11 192-pound right-handed hitting catcher and right-handed pitcher in Illinoisâ€™ 2020 class.  He ran a 7.58 60 and a 4.85 home to first.  He had an 86 mph exit velocity.  At the plate, balanced set up, smooth load, hands walk away from stride, starts slightly open, short the to ball, quick hands, level path, swing produced middle to pull side line drives.  Behind the plate, thin set up in base, slightly staggered, quick and clean transfer, short over the top release, accurate throws, most with carry to the bag, 75 mph positional velocity, pop times between 2.05 and 2.08. On the mound, Powell uses his stocky build and explosive lower half as he works down the mound, repeats delivery with regular effort, controlled leg lift with an in line stride, athletic finish, over the top release. Showed ability to effectively field position and mix fastball and curveball during game action. Fastball is 73-76 mph, strikes to both sides of the plate, occasional late arm side run, curveball is 62-66 mph, gradual 12-to-6 shape, showed some feel for pitch.
